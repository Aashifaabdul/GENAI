# ✨ GENAI Project Hub

Welcome to my **Generative AI** playground – a collection of powerful, creative, and experimental projects designed to push the boundaries of what's possible with local and open-source LLMs, LangChain, and more.

This repository isn't just a showcase — it's a reflection of my journey through AI and how I'm shaping my skills with every project.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

🔹 **AI-Powered Applications**: From smart Q&A bots to creative tools like restaurant name generators and flashcard builders.  
🔹 **LangChain Integrations**: Explore how LLM chains and memory can be applied in real-world use cases.  
🔹 **Local LLMs**: Every project runs on locally hosted models via [Ollama](https://ollama.com), with no external API dependency.  
🔹 **Streamlit Interfaces**: Clean and interactive UIs to demo the models in action.  
🔹 **Expandable Codebase**: Every script is designed to be modular and beginner-friendly.
