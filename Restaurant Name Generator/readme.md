# AI Restaurant Name Generator
This is a simple AI-powered demo app that generates creative and unique restaurant names using Generative AI. Built with Streamlit and Ollama, the app allows users to input a prompt like a cuisine type, and then generates a list of potential restaurant names and the menu items  using a locally running LLM (such as Mistral).
This project is meant to be a basic demonstration of how local large language models can be integrated with a simple frontend. You can customize the model used, tweak the prompt, or expand the features .
